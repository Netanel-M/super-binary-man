# super-binary-man
A javascript platformer game with a binary twist

This is a Javascript platformer game I'm developing as I'm studying HTML 5 technologies.
Currently playable albeit in early stages of development.

## Install instructions
1. First, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Netanel-M/super-binary-man
```

2. Run index.html by opening it in your favorite browser.

3. Alternatively visit [here](https://netanel-m.github.io/super-binary-man/) to play.

## Play guide
Currently a binary sequence is generated at random. Push blocks from the underside to add their number to your sum. Once your sum equals the goal, your score goes up/down. Do this while avoiding enemies.

Consult the image on the bottom for gameplay clarification.
